Hello, and welcome to StACSOS: the St Andrews Computer Science Operating System

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of your coursework tasks is to implement the `ls` command - so there's
currently no way to list the contents of the filesystem in the shell.

However, you can either:

  (a) Look at the generated root file-system tree in the out/ directory, on the
      host system, e.g. `tree out/rootfs/` or `ls -R out/rootfs/`

      (You'll find the compiled user-space binaries in `out/rootfs/usr`)

  (b) Look at the provided applications in the `user/` directory.

  (c) Run `/usr/mandelbrot` or `/usr/poweroff`

Enjoy!
